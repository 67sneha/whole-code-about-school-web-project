        <h3>Greetings of the Time</h3>
        <p>   I am honoured and feel very privileged to be the Principal of GIS, Verkilambi, one of the fast growing schools of the town. It is known for its outstanding educational programme that is robust in its academic aims, innovative in its instructional approach and rigorous in its pursuit for excellence. We offer unlimited opportunities for the students to explore the world and discover themselves. As education is the key to success in the future. It illuminates a person’s mind and thinking. I believe that everyone is entitled to have education “from cradle to grave”. It polishes our mind, reinforces our thoughts and strengthens our character and behaviours towards others.</p><br>
        <p>   I am honoured and feel very privileged to be the Principal of GIS, Verkilambi, one of the fast growing schools of the town. It is known for its outstanding educational programme that is robust in its academic aims, innovative in its instructional approach and rigorous in its pursuit for excellence. We offer unlimited opportunities for the students to explore the world and discover themselves. As education is the key to success in the future. It illuminates a person’s mind and thinking. I believe that everyone is entitled to have education “from cradle to grave”. It polishes our mind, reinforces our thoughts and strengthens our character and behaviours towards others.</p><br>
        <p> The world today is changing at such an accelerated rate and we as educators need to pause and reflect on this entire system of education. The effort of every staff of our school is to unlock the treasure hidden in the soul of a child. Parents play an integral part in the development of the child. The foundation of a successful school is the cooperation between the students, staff and parents. Teachers of high quality, inspirational and passionate teacher is essential to a school’s success. To borrow John Hattie’s words “Teachers should build classroom climates where errors are welcome, student engagement is the norm, questioning is high and students gain reputations as effective learners”. Teachers help them blossom and grow as individuals to enable them to realise their true potential. We encourage our students to develop respectful relationships with their peers, teachers and the broader community. We instil in our students a keen social conscience and the capacity to make ethical decisions.</p><br>
        <p>Technology and automation have been incorporated in the school system, ensuring faster and more convenient way of interaction with our stakeholders. Digital classrooms have been introduced to equip teachers and students with 21st century skills, necessary for all to be lifelong learners.</p><br>
        <p class="lastp"> In GIS each member makes his or her own unique contribution and experiences the joys and struggles of working and growing together, which makes our school a truly special place. We are fortunate to have a very supportive, committed and cooperative management who are available round the clock to provide all the best possible infrastructure and facilities to create a favourable environment for students’ holistic development. Thus, GIS re-affirms that we need to be adaptive and accommodating in this changing world. It is only a collaborative effort of teachers and parents that can lay out the right path, where students are prepared to face all challenges of the world. I wish you all a wonderful school year ahead.</p>
